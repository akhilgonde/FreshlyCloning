How did we start?

Working with 5 group members on a project was altogether new experience for us . from the start of the project to the last day of the project all the group members had given there best. To work as a Team, the most important thing was everyone to be on same platform and to get update on the things going on with the project. So firstly we have created a WhatsApp group of project members and also used Slack platform provided by Masai School to have a communication. We have decided to have two meetings in a day. In morning we used to have meeting at 9.30Am to discuss the day agenda and everyone’s task. Further we used to have meeting at 7:00pm to discuss the task completion and next day agenda. We have also decided to post queries on WhatsApp group in case anyone find dificulties in some concept and depending upon that we used to have urgent meeting as well. So that work should be in progress despite being stuck for some thing.
